More like a POC(Proof Of Concept) based on Angular 4, will upgrade to latest version later.
Take advantage of ``devextreme-angular`` and ``primeng`` components, and try to proof some concept can be done with Angular.

First,
you need to install ``@angular/cli``,
sorry about that.

Then,
run command ``npm install``

run command ``ng serve``
